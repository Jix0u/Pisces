# Pisces: Video Ad Generator Background Music with RNN (LSTMs)
Pisces is a video advertisement generator using Cohere (chat API), Hugging Face (video generation), Google (text to speech) and a background music generation model that harnesses the power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units. This model generates soothing background music tailored to text prompts and advertisements by learning from a vast database of MIDI files.

## How it Works
1. **User Input**: The user provides a text prompt describing the desired advertisement. This could include product details, target audience, desired tone, and other relevant information.
2. **Cohere Chat API**: The text prompt is processed using Cohere's chat API, which generates a coherent and engaging ad script based on the provided input.
3. **Video Generation**: The generated ad script is then fed into Hugging Face's video generation model. This model creates a visual representation of the script, producing a video that aligns with the described advertisement.
4. **Voice Over**: Googleâ€™s text-to-speech API is used to convert the ad script into natural-sounding speech. This voiceover is synchronized with the video to provide an engaging auditory experience.
5. **Background Music Generation RNNs (LSTMs)**: The background music generation model is trained on a vast database of MIDI files. It utilizes Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, which are effective in capturing temporal dependencies in music sequences. Given the ad script, the model generates soothing background music that complements the tone and mood of the advertisement. The LSTM units ensure the music flows naturally and fits well with the video's narrative.
6. **Final Output**: The generated video, synchronized voiceover, and background music are integrated to produce the final advertisement. The result is a cohesive video ad with engaging visuals, clear narration, and soothing background music tailored to the content.
